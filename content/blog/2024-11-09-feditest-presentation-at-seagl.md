Every year, [seagl.org](https://seagl.org/), the Seattle GNU/Linux Conference, takes
place in Seattle.

I had the opportunity [to present](https://pretalx.seagl.org/2024/talk/ZU7MDV/)
our work with FediTest in an hour-long session Saturday morning.

This was a more general technical audience, not particularly focused on the social
web and the Fediverse: almost everybody had heard of the Fediverse, but very few hands
went up when I asked who could explain how it works, technically. So I spent a bit more
time talking about what the various involved protocols do and how they interact, and
only from there launched into the FediTest discussion. Which, a bit to my surprise, went
well, at least the feedback that I received said that people understood what I was saying.
Great!

The session was recorded, but the recording isn't up yet. Once it is, we will link from
here.
