There were a of presentations, discussions and generically good vibes about the open
social web and ActivityPub at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), the open-source conference
in Brussels, Belgium, this past weekend.

[I](https://j12t.org/) gave a FediTest presentation at the FOSDEM Social Web After Hours
at [Hackerspace Brussels](https://hsbxl.be/). In spite of it being rather late,
there were lots of good questions and quite some interest in testing and FediTest in
particular.

Somebody learned about FediTest in this talk, ran FediTest against their own implementation
and reported that they fixed several bugs within 24 hours of the presentation.

Lots of discussions as well about next steps with various Fediverse projects.

In other words, success!
