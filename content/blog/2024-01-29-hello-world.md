So, Hello World, let's get this project started!

We will be hosting periodic community meetings to demo what we are building, discuss
project progress, and get community feedback. So far, we have not scheduled one because we
are just starting and don't have anything to show yet.

To find out when meetings are scheduled, follow
[@feditest@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@feditest) or periodically
check [FediTest.org](/).
