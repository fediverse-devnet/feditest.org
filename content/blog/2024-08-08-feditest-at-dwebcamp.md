Organized again by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), [DWebCamp](https://dwebcamp.org/)
this year brought together over 500 technologists, rights advocates, activists, artists,
entrepreneurs, social and otherwise, and many more, for 3+ days of conference and unconference
under the California Redwoods.

Redwoods, tents and laptops in the same setting? Slide presentations and marshmallows?
Apparently it works!

I had the opportunity to run a workshop on FediTest, and the larger question of how
can we ever ensure the quality of large-scale decentralized, heterogeneous systems
that we are now building, such as in the Fediverse.

We had a good session, good discussion, some high-quality questions that I think I managed
to answer, and generally people seemed to appreciate the project. There was actually
somebody in the audience who said he built a simpler version of this (because he had a
homogenous network to test: every node running the same software, rather than a heterogeneous
network: every node potentially running different software) and appreciated that
we had figured out how to solve that harder problem.

[Here are my slides.](/assets/2024-08-08/feditest-dwebcamp-slides/) (Note: use Safari;
Firefox mangles some of the graphics.)

Lots of details particularly about the key diagram
aren't on the slides, as I would explain those verbally. Come to the next FediTest
meetup if you are interested in those.

P.S. Clearly I'm attempting to summon the forest spirit onto the session attendees.
