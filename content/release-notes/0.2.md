We have our first release!

It's only 0.2 and the first time we have gone through the Python package distribution process,
so expect issues.

The website has also been updated. Documentation and code should now be consistent.

Want to try it out? There's a big menu item "Getting started" at the top of this page.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/fediverse-devnet/feditest/issues/) what we got wrong.
