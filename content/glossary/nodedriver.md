Node Drivers have been implemented in various ways already, from the entirely manual
("Dear user, please now install application X somewhere and enter its DNS name") to
the automated (see {{% gl ubosserver %}}).

FediTest is designed to make it easy for developers to add additional
Node Driver implementations for their own applications and preferences.
