The FediTest project does not produce official testing results. (See
{{% pageref "/blog/2024-06-13-some-tentative-decisions.md" "this post" %}} on why.)
But we may link to some interesting results produced by the community here.

Have some? {{% pageref "/" "Catch us" %}} in the Fediverse or on Matrix.
