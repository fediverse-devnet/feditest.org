title: Node and constellation types
weight: 110
---

FediTest supports several {{% gls node %}} types out of the box that can be
assembled into a variety of {{% gls constellation %}} types. In addition, as FediTest is built
and available as an object framework, and not just a black box of code, developers can
create their own {{% gl node %}} types by subclassing the FediTest Python classes
`Node` and `NodeDriver`.

Here we document {{% gls constellation %}} and the types of {{% gls Node %}} that we have
found useful ourselves, and what they are particularly useful for.

Note: work in progress!
