title: feditest create-testplan
---

This command takes a {{% gl TestPlanSessionTemplate %}} JSON file, such as one
generated by {{% pageref "create-session-template.md" %}}, and one or more
JSON files containing {{% gls Constellation %}}, to produce a {{% gl TestPlan %}}
that runs the tests from {{% gl TestPlanSessionTemplate %}} once for each
specified {{% gl Constellation %}}.

Alternate invocations are available that shortcut some previous steps, such as
creating the {{% gl TestPlan %}} directly from discovered tests and
{{% gl node %}} definitions.

For more info on invocation: `feditest create-testplan --help`.
